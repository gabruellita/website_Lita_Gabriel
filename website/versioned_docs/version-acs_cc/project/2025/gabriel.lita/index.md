## Description
The project consists of a **mini music player** built around a **Raspberry Pi Pico 2**, capable of:
- Playing music from a microSD card.
- Displaying song information on a small LCD screen.
- Supporting **play**, **pause**, **next**, and **previous** controls through physical buttons.
- Using **Rust** with **Embassy** for efficient multitasking.

At first, the device will play audio through a **small speaker** connected via a **PAM8403 mini amplifier**.  
**Optionally**, if the basic setup is successful, the player may be expanded with **headphone jack output** and/or **Bluetooth audio** support.

---

## Motivation
I wanted a **simple external device** that can **play and control music independently** without being tied to a laptop.  
Rust and Embassy provide **the necessary performance and multitasking tools** to manage this efficiently on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

---

## Architecture
The **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** acts as the brain of the system, managing all peripherals:

- **microSD card**: Stores the audio files.
- **DFPlayer Mini**: Handles audio file playback directly from the SD card.
- **Speaker (through PAM8403 amplifier)**: Outputs the audio.
- **LCD 1602 + I2C interface**: Displays the current track information and playback status.
- **Buttons**: Allow control of music playback.

Data flow:
- Pico sends commands to the DFPlayer Mini via UART.
- DFPlayer plays the file and outputs audio to the amplifier and then the speaker.
- Pico updates the LCD and handles button presses asynchronously.

## Log

### Week 5 – 11 May

- Identified and ordered all required components for the project:
  - Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
  - DFPlayer Mini
  - PAM8403 mini amplifier
  - LCD 1602 with I2C interface
  - microSD card, buttons, speaker, jumper wires, breadboard, etc.

- Completed the first version of the technical documentation:
  - Described the main idea and involved components
  - Analyzed the minimum functionality requirements

- Gained a clear understanding of the overall direction:
  - How to communicate with DFPlayer over UART
  - How `embassy` works and how embedded Rust firmware is structured
  - Defined implementation stages
  - Clarified my learning plan (test-driven and incremental)

---

### Week 12 – 18 May

- Assembled and tested the hardware setup successfully:
  - All components were connected and verified:
    - Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
    - DFPlayer Mini
    - PAM8403 audio amplifier
    - LCD 1602 with I2C interface
    - 4 physical push-buttons for playback control

- Added a voltage divider between the Pico’s TX and the DFPlayer’s RX for input protection:
  - R1 = 1kΩ (between TX and divider node)
  - R2 = 2kΩ (between node and GND)
  - The divider reduces the 3.3V TX signal to approximately 2.2V, which is safe for DFPlayer logic input.

- Encountered difficulties using a 3.5mm audio jack module, due to:
  - Impedance mismatch with the PAM8403 BTL amplifier output
  - Potential short circuits when miswiring stereo channels
  - Lack of a proper line-out signal from the DFPlayer Mini
  - Risk of damaging headphones when using a bridged output amplifier

- As a result, I chose to use a physical speaker (8Ω, 2W) connected directly to the L+ / L− output of the PAM8403, which worked well and provided decent volume.

- Wrote a small test program in Rust using `embassy-rp`:
- Successfully configured UART to send basic commands to the DFPlayer (e.g., reset, set volume, play)

### Week 19 – 25 May

- Implemented full async multitasking logic for:
  - Button input handling (play, pause, next, previous)
  - LCD display update (track number and pause/play state)
  - I2C communication with LCD 1602 via hd44780 driver

- Created a system that loops back to track 1 after track 30 is reached
- Integrated `heapless::String` formatting for LCD-safe printing
- Used atomic variables to share track state between tasks safely
- Used defmt logging to trace button presses and playback state changes
- Added debounce handling and edge detection for stable button reading

---

## Hardware Overview
- The **Pico** controls the music player by sending commands over UART to the **DFPlayer Mini**.
- **DFPlayer Mini** reads the audio files from the **microSD card**.
- The audio output is amplified by the **PAM8403 amplifier** and played through a **small speaker**.
- The **LCD 1602** displays song and status info via the I2C interface.
- **Buttons** provide direct user interaction for playback controls.

## Optional Features (Future Extensions)

If the basic functionality is successfully implemented, the project could be extended with:

- **Headphone Jack Output**:  
  Using a **3.5mm Audio Jack Module**, allowing headphone connections.

- **Bluetooth Audio Output**:  
  Integrating a **Bluetooth Audio Receiver Module** to allow wireless music playback.

- **High-Power Amplifier Upgrade**:  
  Switching from the **PAM8403** to a more powerful **TPA3118 amplifier** for better speaker output.

**Note**: These features are optional and depend on the success of the core implementation.
